# SpaceEx-Benchmarks

This repository contains SpaceEx models that serve as a basis for checking the parallel composition operations of CORA. The models employ a varying number of base and network components. 

The SpaceEx website can be found [here](http://spaceex.imag.fr/download-6). Several models have been taken from [ARCH repository](https://cps-vo.org/group/ARCH/benchmarks) and modified to guarantee termination.
